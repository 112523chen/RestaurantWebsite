            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                Tarda Mare is fine dining restaurant founded by Steven Hall in 2002 and based out the upper west side of New York City with multiple locations across the city. 
                Steven Hall believe that sushi is best experience fresh and with others. 
                Tarda Mare has accomplished that by providing a first-class experience that best for a small group of friends, family, or even soon-to-be friends.  
                Despite that we have well crafted experience meant for small groups, we offer similar experience for those that choice to come with a party of 1; but we highly recommend having a party of 2+.

                <h3>Bio:</h3>
                <p>
                    Steven is a Manhattan native and studied at Baruch College Zucklin School of Business 
                    and graduate with Bachelor of Business Administration in Economics in 2000. 
                    He founded Tarda Mare in 2002 as he saw a market where people demanded 
                    high quality sushi and a way for people to connect and no business in the market was supplying that want.
